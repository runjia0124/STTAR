This Datasets is from a Traveling Human Phantom (THP) dataset that was
collected for a multi-site neuroimaging reliability study.  The THP dataset
includes repeated multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images
obtained for five healthy controls performed at eight imaging centers. The
modalities include diffusion weighted images (DWI) and three-dimensional T1
weighted MP-RAGE and T2 SPACE sequences.  Intra-subject and inter-site
variability for MRI scans was and can be assessed as repeated images were taken
across multiple imaging protocols.

Another use for the THP dataset could be to evaluate and improve one's tool
against multi-modal and multi-site data. In addition to the THP dataset, which
is useful as it is, we share our processed results. DWI datasets were processed
to produce common rotationally invariant scalar images and diffusion tensor
images. Anatomical images, T1 and T2, were processed with the BRAINSTools suite
to produce anatomical segmentations.

abstract = {A number of studies are now collecting diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) data across sites. While the reliability of anatomical images has been
established by a number of groups, the reliability of DTI data has not been
studied as extensively. In this study, five healthy controls were recruited and
imaged at eight imaging centers. Repeated measures were obtained across two
imaging protocols allowing intra-subject and inter-site variability to be
assessed. Regional measures within white matter were obtained for standard
rotationally invariant measures: fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity,
radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity. Intra-subject coefficient of
variation (CV) was typically {\textless}1{\%} for all scalars and regions.
Inter-site CV increased to {\~{}}1{\%}-3{\%}. Inter-vendor variation was
similar to inter-site variability. This variability includes differences in the
actual implementation of the sequence.}, author = {Magnotta, Vincent a. and
